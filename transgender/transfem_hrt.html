		<h1 style="padding-bottom: 25px;"1>Risk-based transfeminine HRT guide</h1>

		<h2>Why DIY?</h2>
		doctors suck absolute ass. the process for getting hrt on the nhs is years long to see a specialist, a demeaning interrogation once you get there, all to be underdosed for months if you're lucky or your whole transition if you're not.<br>
		private healthcare providers exist at the cost of aproximately 1 (one) arm and 1 (one) leg. and increasingly general practitioners are refusing to particiapte in shared care agreements.<br>
		trans healthcare is one of the hottest points of the culture war today. you cannot trust any authority not to throw us under the bus to win right wing voters. we must manage our care ourselves.<br>

		
		<h2>Possible Risks</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>sex hormone deficiency</li>
			<li>zero testosterone</li>
			<li>antiandrogen side-effects</li>
			<li>liver damage</li>
			<li>unsupressed testosterone</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Estrogen Routes</h2>
		<h3>Oral Pills</h3>
		estrogen pills that you swallow.<br>
		most commonly prescribed by doctors.<br>
		the estrogen in the pill is metabolised by the liver where it is converted into estrone. the estrone is then remetabolised in the cells into estrogen.<br>
		provides a steady dose throughout the day<br>
		low bioavailability mean hormone blocker required.<br>
		going through the liver adds unnecessary strain and can contribute to liver failure. this makes regular blood tests quite important.

		<h3>Sublingual Pills</h3>
		estrogen pills that you dissolve under your tounge or between your lips and gums.<br>
		physically the same medication as oral pills, you just use them differently. this means they can be obtained by a doctor or ordered from a pharmacy (noramlly overseas).<br>
		this method avoids the liver almost entirely and goes into the capiliaries in the gums and into the blood. this has the advantage of being very efficient at raising blood estrogen levels (often 2.5x), however the disadvantage of a short half-life (doses are normally recomended every 8-10 hours).<br>
		how easily the estrogen is absorbed and how long it staying in the blood can be very variable between different people. for some this is a perfectly healthy way to perform monotherapy but others still need blockers to supress testosterone.
		
		<h3>Injectable Estrogen</h3>
		estrogen ester suspended in fat-soluble oil and sterilising alcohol.<br>
		in the uk this is only possible to buy from homebrew vendors. this isn't a large risk however as these are experienced manufacturers and used and tested by thousands of trans people across the globe.<br>
		super super cheap. super easy to monotherapy. stable* levels depending on the ester. makes you 30% cooler<br>
		improper sterilisation can cause infection, poor needle technique can ccause bruising, vial coring can cause injecting small pieces of rubber. all of these can be mitiaged easily<br>

		<h3>Estrogen Gel</h3>
		sloppy toppy.

		<h3>Patches</h3>
		pretty cool.<br>
		hella expesive to diy (still cheaper than private)<br>
		often supply shortages<br>
		absorbtion rate differs person to person. some people can use for monotherapy<br>
		lowest-risk route the nhs can provide, often preffered for older patients (40+)<br>

		<h3>bonus: Sublingual Oil</h3>
		homebrew girljuice. I'll get back to you :3<br>

		<h2>Antiandrogens</h2>
		<h3>Cyproterone Acetate</h3>
		very strong gonadal testosterone supressor.<br>
		cheaply available from overseas pharmacies.<br>
		typically comes in 50mg dose pills which require cutting into quarters or even eigths before injesting.<br>
		due to the very low dose required, this blocker is by far the cheapest and one order will likely last until the medication expires.<br>
		a commonly experienced side-effect is decreased libido and some people have difficulty achieving errection. (this medication is sometimes used in cis men to treat hypersexuality).<br>
		extremely high doses are also used in cis men to treat early stages of prostate cancer. at 200-300mg cypro is assosiated with a risk of brain tumor. this risk is almost nonexistant in the dose relevant to tranfem people (6.25mg) as there have been no recorded cases of transfemine people developing brain tumors.<br> 

		<h3>Bicaltumide</h3>
		inhibits testosterone recoptors rather than stopping testosterone production.<br>
		also available from overseas pharmacies.<br>
		harder to determine correct dose as a blood test cannot confirm how well it works (testosterone levels are unnaffected)<br>
		chance of liver/lung toxicity for some people. (if you survive a year you'll be fine).<br>


		<h3>Spirolactone</h3>
		go piss girl.<br>

		<h3>GNRH</h3>
		gold standard. almost impossible to diy.
