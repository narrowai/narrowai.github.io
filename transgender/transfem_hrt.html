		<h2>Estrogen Routes</h2>
		<h3>Oral Pills</h3>
		estrogen pills that you swallow.<br>
		most commonly prescribed by doctors.<br>
		the estrogen in the pill is metabolised by the liver where it is converted into estrone. the estrone is then remetabolised in the cells into estrogen.<br>
		provides a steady dose throughout the day<br>
		low bioavailability mean hormone blocker required.<br>
		going through the liver adds unnecessary strain and can contribute to liver failure. this makes regular blood tests quite important.

		<h3>Sublingual Pills</h3>
		estrogen pills that you dissolve under your tounge or between your lips and gums.<br>
		physically the same medication as oral pills, you just use them differently. this means they can be obtained by a doctor or ordered from a pharmacy (noramlly overseas).<br>
		this method avoids the liver almost entirely and goes into the capiliaries in the gums and into the blood. this has the advantage of being very efficient at raising blood estrogen levels (often 2.5x), however the disadvantage of a short half-life (doses are normally recomended every 8-10 hours).<br>
		how easily the estrogen is absorbed and how long it staying in the blood can be very variable between different people. for some this is a perfectly healthy way to perform monotherapy but others still need blockers to supress testosterone.
		
		<h3>Injectable Estrogen</h3>
		estrogen ester suspended in fat-soluble oil and sterilising alcohol.<br>
		in the uk this is only possible to buy from homebrew vendors. this isn't a large risk however as these are experienced manufacturers and used and tested by thousands of trans people across the globe.<br>
		super super cheap. super easy to monotherapy. stable* levels depending on the ester. makes you 30% cooler<br>
		improper sterilisation can cause infection, poor needle technique can ccause bruising, vial coring can cause injecting small pieces of rubber. all of these can be mitiaged easily<br>

		<h3>Estrogen Gel</h3>
		sloppy toppy.

		<h3>Patches</h3>
		pretty cool.<br>
		hella expesive to diy (still cheaper than private)<br>
		often supply shortages<br>
		absorbtion rate differs person to person. some people can use for monotherapy<br>
		lowest-risk route the nhs can provide, often preffered for older patients (40+)<br>

		<h3>bonus: Sublingual Oil</h3>
		homebrew girljuice. I'll get back to you :3<br>

		<h2>Antiandrogens</h2>
		<h3>Cyproterone Acetate</h3>
		bye bye boners.

		<h3>Bicaltumide</h3>
		cannae test it.

		<h3>Spirolactone</h3>
		go piss girl.

		<h3>GNRH</h3>
		gold standard. almost impossible to diy.
