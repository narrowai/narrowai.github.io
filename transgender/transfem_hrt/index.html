		<h2>what even is anthing?</h2>
		hrt (hormone replacement therapy) is a genreral name for medicines that change your body's hormone profile. it is used by cis men as steroids and it's used by cis women to treat menopause.<br>
		trans stuff is cooler tho

		<h2>Universal Risks of Estrogen</h2>
		<h3>Breast Cancer</h3>
		the increased risk of breast cancer is twofold: having more breast tissue obviously means there is more area for and therefor a higher chance of cancer developing, and estrogen promotes growth and activity in the breast tissue which also increases the chance of cancer.<br>
		reverse of this is also true: atropy and decreased cellular activity in the testicles and prostate means you are less likely to get cancer in these organs. in fact - estrogen used to be used as a treatment for prosate cancer [needs citation].
		<h3>Stroke</h3>
		with estrogen as your dominant sex hormone, you are slightly more likey to have a stroke. this is very minor however and shared with every cis woman.
		
		<h2>Route-specifi Risks</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>sex hormone deficiency</li>
			<li>zero testosterone</li>
			<li>antiandrogen side-effects</li>
			<li>liver damage</li>
			<li>unsupressed testosterone</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Estrogen Routes</h2>
		<h3>Oral Pills</h3>
		<!--what is it-->estrogen pills that you swallow.<br>
		<!--where to get it-->most commonly prescribed by doctors.<br>
		<!--what it does-->the estrogen in the pill is metabolised by the liver where it is converted into estrone. the estrone is then remetabolised in the cells into estrogen.<br>
		provides a steady dose throughout the day<br>
		low bioavailability mean hormone blocker required.<br>
		going through the liver adds unnecessary strain and can contribute to liver failure. furthermore, the low bioavailbility means that often patients have estrogen levels below the healthy range. both of these make regular blood tests quite important.

		<h3>Sublingual Pills</h3>
		<!--what is it-->estrogen pills that you dissolve under your tounge (sublingual) or between your lips and gums (buccal).<br>
		physically the same medication as oral pills, you just use them differently. <!--where to get it-->this means they can be obtained by a doctor or ordered from a pharmacy (noramlly overseas).<br>
		<!--what it does-->this method avoids the liver almost entirely and goes into the capiliaries in the gums and into the blood. this has the advantage of being very efficient at raising blood estrogen levels (often 2.5x), however the disadvantage of a short half-life (doses are normally recomended every 8-10 hours).<br>
		how easily the estrogen is absorbed and how long it staying in the blood can be very variable between different people. for some this is a perfectly healthy way to perform monotherapy but others still need blockers to supress testosterone.
		
		<h3>Injectable Estrogen</h3>
		<!--what is it-->estrogen ester suspended in fat-soluble oil and sterilising alcohol.<br>
		<!--where to get it-->in the uk this is only possible to buy from homebrew vendors. this isn't a large risk however as these are experienced manufacturers and used and tested by thousands of trans people across the globe.<br>
		<!--what it does-->estrogen is injected into the fat or muscle (typically around the stomach or thighs)<br>
		super super cheap. super easy to monotherapy. stable* levels depending on the ester. makes you 30% cooler<br>
		improper sterilisation can cause infection, poor needle technique can ccause bruising, vial coring can cause injecting small pieces of rubber. all of these can be mitiaged easily<br>

		<h3>Estrogen Gel</h3>
		<!--what is it-->sloppy toppy.
		<!--where to get it-->manufactured by both pharmacuticle companies and homebrewers, these can be prescribed by a doctor or bought froma homebrew vendor. it is also the easiest form of estrogen to manufacture yourself (not requireing a totally sterile environment like injectables).

		<h3>Patches</h3>
		<!--what is it--> a patch similar to a plaster that stays on you constantly and slowly releases estrogen into your body through the skin.<br>
		<!--where to get it-->hella expesive to diy (still cheaper than private). these can be precibed privately, or on the nhs through a GIC or as a bridging prescription.<br>
		unfortunately, there are often supply shortages<br>
		absorbtion rate differs person to person. some people can use for monotherapy<br>
		lowest-risk route the nhs can provide, often preffered for older patients (40+)<br>

		<h3>bonus: Sublingual Oil</h3>
		<!--what is it-->homebrew girljuice. I'll get back to you :3<br>
		<!--where to get it-->

		<h2>Antiandrogens</h2>
		<h3>Cyproterone Acetate</h3>
		<!--what is it-->very strong gonadal testosterone supressor.<br>
		<!--where to get it-->cheaply available from overseas pharmacies.<br>
		typically comes in 50mg dose pills which require cutting into quarters or even eigths before injesting.<br>
		due to the very low dose required, this blocker is by far the cheapest and one order will likely last until the medication expires.<br>
		a commonly experienced side-effect is decreased libido and some people have difficulty achieving errection. (this medication is sometimes used in cis men to treat hypersexuality).<br>
		extremely high doses are also used in cis men to treat early stages of prostate cancer. at 200-300mg cypro is assosiated with a risk of brain tumor. this risk is almost nonexistant in the dose relevant to tranfem people (6.25mg) as there have been no recorded cases of transfemine people developing brain tumors.<br> 

		<h3>Bicaltumide</h3>
		<!--what is it-->
		inhibits testosterone recoptors rather than stopping testosterone production.<br>
		<!--where to get it-->also available from overseas pharmacies.<br>
		harder to determine correct dose as a blood test cannot confirm how well it works (testosterone levels are unnaffected)<br>
		chance of liver/lung toxicity for some people. (if you survive a year you'll be fine).<br>


		<h3>Spirolactone</h3>
		go piss girl.<br>

		<h3>GNRH</h3>
		<!--what is it-->gold standard. almost impossible to diy.
