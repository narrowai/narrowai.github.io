		<h1>Why DIY?</h1>
		Why should I DIY at all. Isn't it better to get a real doctor and do what they say?<br>

		doctors suck absolute ass. the process for getting hrt on the nhs is years long to see a specialist, a demeaning interrogation once you get there, all to be underdosed for months if you're lucky or your whole transition if you're not.<br>
		private healthcare providers exist at the cost of aproximately 1 (one) arm and 1 (one) leg. and increasingly general practitioners are refusing to particiapte in shared care agreements.<br>
		trans healthcare is one of the hottest points of the culture war today. you cannot trust any authority not to throw us under the bus to win right wing voters. we must manage our care ourselves.<br>

		<h2>A doctor is a better choice for some</h2>
		if you have other conditions that can increase your risk profile when taking hrt (e.g: liver damage, breast cancer).
		if you have lots of anxiety.
		gnrh.

		<h2>More options</h2>
		in the uk you can't be prescribed injectables.

		<h2>Decide your own dose</h2>
		doctors will start by underdosing your estrogen. this is done "to test for allergies" but they slowly titrate your dose upwards. 

		<h2>Informed consent</h2>
		nhs doctors require you to attend (often more than one) invasive psychological exam for gender dysphoria. this can include attempts to convince you not to medicate.

		<h2>No surveilance</h2>
		government knows nothing. (until you get a blood test and change your documents)
