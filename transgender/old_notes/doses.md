# introduction dose
nia says start on ~1mg daily w no blocker, then ramp to like 2mg with 50% blocker, then full dose
some sources claim that a higher starting dose can have negative impacts, especially wrt breast development. other places say it's fine. need to ask cliniq what they think.

official nhs says start on 2mg oral and increase by 1mg after every blood test. but that means taking 9 months to get to 6mg which seems too slow? idk doctors are a bit silly.

prob best to start on oral due to longer half life (more stable level). oral is also ~Â½ the dose.
either half a 2mg or a 1.5 would really be okay.


# long-term dose
probably like 1.5mg sublingual idk (achieved by quartering a 2mg EH pill). although I've seen self reports of people doing mono on 6mg sublingual (4 doses: 1,2,1,2).

[doses table](https://transfemscience.org/articles/e2-equivalent-doses)
this guide also curiously includes theoretical doses for monotherapy with every form, even though for most this is considered very inadvisable due to the increased health risks (the liver would struggle with that many pills) and lack of efficacy (the skin cannot absorb cream that well).
