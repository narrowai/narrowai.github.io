# anti-androgens
first things first you need to suppress your t. it is important to research these in trans spaces as many of the side effects for cis people relate more to sex-hormone deficiency.

### spironolactone
widely regarded as the worst for side effects. it's a diuretic so you need to pee all the time and crave salt.

### cyproterone acetate
a way more active progestogen than antiandrogen. because of this, when used as an antiandrogen there is profound progestogenic overdosage[^2] as well as associated side effects and risks. this may lead to less desirable effects like increased weight gain and risk of brain tumours in transfem people.
historically was given at doses of up to 200mg a day. it is now known that between 5 to 10mg is equivalently effective[^2] so anything over 10mg daily is considered an unnecessary risk[^3].
Many in the community accept cypro as basically safe, but medical authorities do not suggest continued use for more than a few years[^3].

### bicalutamide
unacceptably high risk of liver and lung toxicity[^4] developing for use in trangender individuals.

### gnrh agonists
can cause a flair up of t at first so take another blocker with for like 3 weeks. often comes in nasal spray form so can be quite awkward.

### monotherapy
a fuckload of e can be a blocker all on its own. this is only advisable using injections or patches[^1] as the dosage required for pills or spray would cause more issues with the liver than blockers would. monotherapy seems to be the only method that has potential for long-term/potential infertily.

# estrogen

### pills
most expensive, most well known. absorb best by doing sublingual but this causes a higher peak so you need to space out the doses more (usually 3x daily)
bioidentical:
* estradiol hemihydrate (e.g. estrofem, estrace)
* estradiol
* estradiol valerate ~75% potency of other types
==avoid premarin or ethinylestradiol. these aren't bioidentical and have more risks==

### transdermal (gels, patches)
* patches, some are changed weekly, others are biweekly.
* gels are typically not pre-portioned when diy so super hard to get the right dose.
* solutions are like an eydropper for skin. seems super weird idk.
* creams. also hard to get exact dose.

### injections
literally just don't because needles are scary and you won't be able to donate blood.

### pellets
no silly, doctors hate trannies.
